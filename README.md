# Music Generator

This is a project that uses a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to generate music based on a given genre and mood. The LSTM is trained on MIDI files of different genres and moods, and can produce new MIDI files that can be played by any music software.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
- Music21
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage

- Clone this repository or download the files.
- Run the `Music_Generator.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Upload your favourite music MIDI files into runtime storage.
- Execute all the cells.
- Download the processed MIDI file.
- Open it with any Music production software (Ex. LMMS)
- Enjoy the music!
